Generating Bitmap Fonts
--

It's recommended that bitmap fonts be generated with Hiero, a tool distributed with libGDX.

Generating SDF Images
--

Distance field images can be generated by this tool:

https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen

OkUI expects the distance field to be in the alpha channel, so you'll need to convert the output of
that to the alpha channel of a white image (In Pixelmator, all you have to do is double click the
"Mask to Alpha" effect.).
